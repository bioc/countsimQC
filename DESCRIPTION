Title: Compare Characteristic Features of Count Data Sets
Version: 0.3.0
Author: Charlotte Soneson
Maintainer: Charlotte Soneson <charlottesoneson@gmail.com>
Description: countsimQC provides functionality to create a comprehensive report 
    comparing many different characteristics across a collection of (RNA-seq) count matrices. 
    It is mainly intended as a simple way to compare one or more synthetic RNA-seq count 
    matrices to a real count matrix, possibly the one underlying the simulation. 
    However, any collection of count matrices can be compared.
