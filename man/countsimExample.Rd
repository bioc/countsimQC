A named list with three elements, each corresponding to a (real or simulated)
count data set.

\details{
The \code{Original} data set represents a subset of 10,000 genes and 11 cells
from the GSE74596 single-cell RNA-seq data set, obtained from the conquer
repository (http://imlspenticton.uzh.ch:3838/conquer/). The \code{Sim1} and
\code{Sim2} data sets similarly represent subsets of scRNA-seq data sets
simulated with two different simulation methods, using the real GSE74596 data
set as the basis for parameter estimation. Each data set is represented as a
\code{DESeqDataSet} object.
